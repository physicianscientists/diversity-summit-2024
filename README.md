The Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF) is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences by supporting research as well as scientific and educational activities. This fund has supported APSAâ€™s Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Working Group (PST-DWG) in creating the Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit, which first met in 2019. BWF is once again supporting the Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit on Thursday, June 27 to Friday, June 28, 2024 in Raleigh, North Carolina.


The Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit will comprise 80 partners and participants, who are experienced in addressing barriers to physician scientist careers or are undergoing physician scientist training. This summit will not only give APSA an opportunity to convene its stakeholders and discuss the important topic of diversity in the physician scientist community, but also enable individuals from diverse backgrounds to support one another across various stages of training.


Our major goal from this summit is to utilize Human-Centered Design Thinking Sessions as a mechanism for developing a strategic plan for APSA and participants to work towards fulfilling and coordinating a research study to address questions related to physician scientist diversity.
