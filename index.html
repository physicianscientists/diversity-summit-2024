    <h1 class="purpose-titles">Purpose</h1>

    <p class="purpose-paragraphs">The Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF) is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences by supporting research as well as scientific and educational activities. This fund has supported APSA’s Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Working Group (PST-DWG) in creating the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit, which first met in 2019</span>. BWF is once again supporting the Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thursday, June 27 to Friday, June 28, 2024 in Raleigh, North Carolina</span>. 
    </p>

    <p class="purpose-paragraphs">The Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit will comprise 80 partners and participants, who are experienced in addressing barriers to physician scientist careers or are undergoing physician scientist training. This summit will not only give APSA an opportunity to convene its stakeholders and discuss the important topic of diversity in the physician scientist community, but also enable individuals from diverse backgrounds to support one another across various stages of training.</p>

    <p class="purpose-paragraphs">Our major goal from this summit is to utilize <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-human-centered-design" target="_blank">Human-Centered Design Thinking Sessions</a> as a mechanism for developing a strategic plan for APSA and participants to work towards fulfilling and coordinating a research study to address questions related to physician scientist diversity.</p>

She previously attended Princeton University and earned a degree in Molecular Biology where she completed an award-winning thesis on the in vivo immunopathogenesis of yellow fever and contributed to developing tools for its study at the single-cell resolution. While she has yet to decide on a home for her PhD, she is currently leading a project on dissecting the immunopathogenesis of dengue virus in a Dominican Republic pediatric population along with Dr. Edward Behrens at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In the face of suspended clerkships and closed labs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she is leading regional efforts for the Connect for COVID-19 initiative, to ensure that COVID-19 patients and nursing home residents in Philadelphia have the video-enabled devices they need to stay connected with loved ones during this time. In her free time, she devours books, hikes and travels with her friends and fiancée, and sits in the sun (with sunblock, of course). Her career goals are to leverage her experience and privilege as a physician-scientist trainee to both target pathogens that threaten global underserved communities and increase multi-faceted diversity in her career path.

          Minh Pham is a recent graduate student at UCLA majoring in Biochemistry. Originally from Vietnam and as a Vietnamese American and son of a refugee, Medi-Cal recipient himself who immigrated to the United States thirteen(13) years ago, Minh experienced many personal and academic obstacles. Minh spoke little to no English and had difficulty communicating with others at the beginning. Through several Vietnamese community service programs and tremendous experiences working with various communities, especially the medically underserved community, Minh realized he was not alone; he found others to whom he could relate, particularly the struggles of other immigrant and first-generation college students. Since then, he has been working tirelessly as a volunteer and community organizer from various nonprofit, private, and public sectors to advocate for our underserved, minority, and low-income communities in Orange County for better healthcare services and the voice of our community's youth. Minh aspires to become a community physician-scientist with a focus on public health and public policy. Over the past 3 years In APSA, Minh was a part of various committees to support the mission and raise awareness of APSA throughout the community and across different campuses. Some of the positions include but are not limited to APSA Virtual Content (VC) Committee Member; APSA Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Committee Member/Vice-Chair; APSA Public Relations (PR) Committee Member/Vice-Chair, APSA Fundraising Committee Vice-Chair; APSA Policy Committee Member to work on policy project in collaboration with NSPN (National Science Policy Network); APSA VC-PR Liaison and Institutional Representative (IR) for Santa Ana College/Santiago Canyon College.
