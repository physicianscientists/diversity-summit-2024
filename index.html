    <p class="section-paragraphs">The Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF) is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences by supporting research as well as scientific and educational activities. This fund has supported APSAâ€™s Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Working Group (PST-DWG) in creating the Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit on June 21-22, 2019 in Durham, NC. BWF is once again supporting the Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit on June 27-28, 2024.</p>

    <p class="section-paragraphs">The Physician Scientist Trainee Diversity Summit will comprise 70-80 partners and participants, like yourself, who are experienced in addressing barriers to physician scientists careers or are undergoing physician scientist training. Our major goal from this summit is to utilize Human-Centered Design Thinking Sessions as a mechanism for developing a strategic plan, coordinating a research study to address questions related to physician scientist diversity, and to codify outcomes from our discussion for publication.</p>

    <p class="section-paragraphs">This summit will not only give APSA an opportunity to convene its stakeholders and discuss the important topic of diversity in the physician scientist community, but also enable individuals from diverse backgrounds to support one another across various stages of training.</p>
